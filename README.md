Tezos Indexer by Baking Bad

TzKT is the most advanced Tezos blockchain indexer with powerful API created by the Baking Bad team with huge support from the Tezos Foundation.

The indexer fetches raw data from the Tezos node, then processes it and stores in the database in such a way as to provide effective access to the blockchain data. This project aims to collect txs data from the Tezos TzKT indexers API's.
